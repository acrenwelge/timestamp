This is a very simple timestamp service written with Node.js and Express, done per the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

To deploy this locally:

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/acrenwelge/timestamp.git
cd timestamp/
npm install # assuming you have npm installed already...
npm start # or run "node server.js" - the npm script runs this command
```
